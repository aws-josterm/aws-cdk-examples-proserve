## AWS CDK Examples - ProServe

This repository contains a set of CDK example projects which have been developed by
AWS Professional Services (ProServe).

The examples in this repository are organized by functionality. Within each
business function, there may be multiple language-specific implementations, since the
CDK supports multiple programming languages.

Each section contains its own README file, which describes:
 - Background of the business problem
 - Prerequisites
 - Items for consideration
 - Sample output

If a language-specific implementation requires special instructions, then a README file within
the language-specific subdirectory will elaborate upon it. (For a complete list of supported
languages, please refer to the AWS CDK FAQ mentioned below.)

The recommended starting point is the `hello-world` example.
